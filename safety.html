<h1>How to be Safe Online</h1></div>
	<div class="column"><h4>The biggest part of cyber security is of course the security aspect and making sure people are secure and can protect themselves online. Therefore the best ways to protect yourself online are as follows:<br><br>Make sure that you have a strong and secure password or even multiple strong passwords so that if someone attempts to break into your account then they will have a much more difficult time doing so.<br><br>Constantly check your devices to make sure that they are up to date so that the security systems are state of the art (2022).<br><br>Never share your private information with anyone online so that you won't be risking someone taking that information and using it to access your accounts.<br><br>
	  Using a VPN is a good option as it hides your IP adress from people trying to steal information from you (Rubenking and Duffy, 2021).<br><br>If you or someone you know has been hacked or had information stolen make sure to get in contact with the appropriate autorities such as the <a href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/">Action Fraud Police.</a><br><br>Try to spot if an e-mail is fake as they will likely be trying to con or scam you to get important information such as your card details, the technical term for this is phishing as they are trying to bait you into giving up private information to them.(10 Ways to Stay Safe Online | HSBC China, 2022).</h4>
