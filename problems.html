<h1>The Problems with Cyber Security</h1></div>
	<div class="column"><h4>The most well known cases of there being problems with cyber security is when there have been successful cyber attacks on businesses and organisations. Andy Haldan from the Bank of England even went as far as to state that "cyber attacks are a bigger threat to the banks than the euro crisis" (Myles, 2015). Some of the biggest and most well known cyber attacks are as follows:<br><br>
	  The cyber attack on Yahoo is one of the biggest and most well known attacks. This attack happened whilst Yahoo was being aquired by Verizon and the group that hacked Yahoo managed to access the information of around 3 billion accounts. This was a major failure in the cyber security of Yahoo as their defenses failed to stop the group from stealing information from that many users (Hill and Swinhoe, 2022).<br><br>Another major cyber attack was the attack on LinkedIn in 2021. This attack saw the information of 700 million users (over 90% of the sites users) get posted on the dark web, the hacker responsible did this by exploiting the sites API to aquire the user data (Hill and Swinhoe, 2022).<br><br>The Ransomware attack on the NHS in 2017 is another well known attack that resulted in the UK losin £92 million. This attack exposed a specific vulnerability with microsoft and ended up infecting most NHS devices with Ransomware, this ended up with the cancellation of thousands of NHS appoinments and operations (The NHS cyber attack, 2022).</h4>
