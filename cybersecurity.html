<h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1></div>
<div class="column">
<h4>Cyber security is a practice that has been around for some time now and came about due to the increasing threats posed by cyber attacks over time. In simple terms, cyber security is the practice of maintaining the security of cyber space. However, the true definition of cyber security is much more complicated than this.<br><br>Since cyber security is a very broad term then it also has many varying definitions. possibly the best definition of cyber security comes from Craigen et al. who states that cyber security is "the organisation of processes, resources and structures made to protect cyber space and it's systems from occurances that misalign de jure from de facto property rights."(Craigen, Diakun-Thibault and Purse, 2014). This means that cyber seurity is the protection of cyber space through the use of various different systems, this can also be split into corporate cyber security which protects corporate businesses and organisations and national cyber security which is the protection of the general population through cyber security.<br><br>
Examples of cyber security can be: the use of anti virus software, setting up firewalls to protect from unauthorized access, protecting passwords and personal information.</h4></div>
