	<h3>Cyber Security Then</h3><br><br>
		<h4>Cyber security has been around for some time now with it's roots dating back to the 1970s, Warner(2012) wrote about the rise and history of cyber security where they showed that the 1970s saw the first advances in cyber security with the introduction of "hashed passwords, administrator privelages, file system permissions and the start of the encryption of data flowing between computers". The 1980s saw the beginning of new types of cyber attacks such as "Trojan horse's" and the "Computer virus" (History of Cyber Security, 2022), this then forced the development of many types of antivirus softwares such as "F-Prot" and "ThunderBYTE" (History of Cyber Security, 2022).</h4>

	<div class="column3"><h3>Cyber Security Now</h3><br><br><h4>In more recent times cyber security has had to advance due to the rising threats posed by hackers and cyber attacks. It is known that in the 1990s the first polymorphic viruses were created and in reaction to this came the introduction of the first firewall programs with the intent to protect the public from malware and viruses(Chadd, 2022). Later on in the 2000s it is known that threats began to become bigger and bigger with punishments becoming more severe and security becoming more advanced(2022). In the 2010s cyber security began to develop next-gen technology, which is cyber security that uses an array of different processes to detect all types of unprecedented threats, examples of this are "multi factor authentification" and "real time protection"(Chadd, 2022). </h4></div>
